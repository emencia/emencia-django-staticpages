Version 0.4.0 - 2014/10/01
--------------------------

**Last version with Python3.6 and Django<2.2 version**

In these old times, there was no changelog. Application was using a totally different
strategy where you explicitely define all page url options (url regex path, url path,
url name).

0.4.0 was the last release from this era and was compatible with Python 3.6 and
Django prior 2.0 version.
